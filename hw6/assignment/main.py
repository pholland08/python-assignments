7.1 Write a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 50 counting by 5.
	This function must use a while loop.

"""
7.2 Write a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns the number of spaces in the string.
	This function must use a while loop.

"""
7.3 Write a function that asks the user to enter exam scores one at a time until the word stop is entered.
	When stop is entered, the program should compute the average of the scores.

7.8 Add another condition to createClusters function to make sure that no more than maxRepeats number of iterations occur.

7.10 Load and run the code for the visualizeQuakes function.
	How do your results compare with those in the book?

"""
7.11 Try to change the number of clusters. Be sure to add more colors if you add more clusters.
	I need to see a screen shot of the output.

7.12 Go to https://earthquake.usgs.gov/static/lfs/nshm/afghanistan/data/downloads/AFF_GR_WUS.out_rev1.pga.txt

	Make all the necessary changes in order to run visualizeQuakes or change the readData function to match.
	(A plus will be to those who will read the file directly from the web using urlib.request module we covered earlier in chapter 5)
	The solutions are extensions of the basic code that already supplied to you in the course materials for this week.
